# C++ Objects and Pointers: Foundations for Cybersecurity

## Overview

This repository showcases a C++ project developed as part of my coursework at Colorado Technical University. The project highlights the practical application of foundational programming concepts, focusing on objects, classes, and pointers. These skills are essential for building secure and efficient software, which plays a critical role in the cybersecurity landscape.

### Key Features

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Functions and pointers
- Dynamic memory management

## Relevance to Cybersecurity

Understanding C++ is critical for system-level programming and secure software development, forming the backbone of many cybersecurity tools and techniques. This project demonstrates:

- Core programming skills necessary for secure software development
- Insights into memory management, a critical factor in preventing buffer overflows
- Practical problem-solving with structured programming approaches
